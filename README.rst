Configuration
=============

- During the first login you will be asked for your full name and email address to be used for your Git commits
- Git has already been configured with ``push.default = simple``
- A PostgreSQL database named "django" has already been created for you
- User and password for the PostgreSQL database are both ``django``
- PostgreSQL database name and user are also available as environment variables ``DB_NAME`` and ``DB_USER``
- APT is configured to use German Ubuntu mirror servers
- An environment variable ``ENV=vagrant`` has been set, to be used in scripts etc.
- Port 8000 on the guest will be forwarded to the same port on the host (usually used for the Django development web server)
- Port 61208 on the guest will be forwarded to the same port on the host (used for the Glances web server)
- Auto correction for port forwarding is enabled, so port numbers can be different - use the ``vagrant port`` command to display them
- Timezone is set to Europe/Berlin

Installation
============

Download `Vagrant 1.8 <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>`_ and
`VirtualBox 5.0 <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ for your operating system and
architecture, then install both.

Usage
=====

To create and boot a new Vagrant box, run:

::

    $ vagrant init -m transcode/django
    $ vagrant up

Now connect to the new box:

::

    $ vagrant ssh

That's it! Now change your working directory to ``/vagrant`` and start working
on your Django project!

Building and uploading a Vagrant box

This repository contains a ``Makefile`` with tasks to build, package and upload
the Vagrant box to Amazon S3.
