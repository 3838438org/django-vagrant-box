Configuration
=============

- During the first login you will be asked for your full name and email address to be used for your git commits
- Git has already been configured with ``push.default = simple``
- A PostgreSQL database named "django" has already been created for you
- User and password for the PostgreSQL database are both ``django``
- PostgreSQL database name and user are also available as environment variables ``DB_NAME`` and ``DB_USER``
- apt is configured to use German Ubuntu mirror servers
- An environment variable ``ENV=vagrant`` has been set, to be used in scripts etc.
- Port 8000 on the guest will be forwarded to the same port on the host (usually used for the Django development web server)
- Port 61208 on the guest will be forwarded to the same port on the host (used for the Glances web server)
- Auto correction for port forwarding is enabled, so port numbers can be different - use the ``vagrant port`` command to display them

Installation
============

`Download Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>`_ for your
operating system and architecture, then install it.
